This directory is initially empty but will contain the output data sets:
 * the 2011 Remoteness Index
 * and the 2016 Remoteness Index.

The agglomeration level (AggLvl) is simply the remoteness index prior to
rescaling (min-max normalisation) between 0 and 1.

Examples of the data sets are shown below
(note all data displayed below is fictive and for example only):
