This directory should host six data sets,
three for each time period (2016 and 2011):
 * the travel cost matrix (road network distance from CSD to PopCtr),
 * the PopCtrs data set (with population),
 * and the CSDs data set (with CSD attributes).

Examples of the data sets are shown below
(note all data displayed below is fictive and for example only):
